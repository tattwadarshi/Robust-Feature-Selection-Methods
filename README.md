# Robust-Feature-Selection-Methods
A unique approach to quickly select the best features in a dataset

**In all  these notebooks we have identified some unique ways to select features more quickly and accurately in a variety of datasets. The coding structure is generalized and can be applied to a large variety of machine learning problems. We have tested it on many datasets on Kaggle and inbuilt datsets in Scikit-learn. **

All the notebooks are provided with sufficient documentation and explanation. Narratives are given at each stage.
